\section{Cryptographic Framework}\label{sec:crypto_framework}

\subsection{One-Way Property}

The Collatz function exhibits properties similar to cryptographic hash functions, particularly in its one-way nature. For odd integers, the transformation can be viewed as:

\[
T_{odd}(n) = \frac{3n + 1}{2^{\tau(n)}}
\]

where $\tau(n)$ is the largest power of 2 that divides $3n + 1$.

\begin{theorem}[One-Way Property]\label{thm:one_way}
Given an odd integer $n$ and its image $m = T_{odd}(n)$, finding $n$ requires $O(\log m)$ operations.
\end{theorem}

The proof follows from analyzing the predecessor equation:
\[
3n + 1 = m2^k
\]
which requires checking multiple values of $k$ to find valid predecessors.

\subsection{Avalanche Effect}

\begin{theorem}[Avalanche Effect]\label{thm:avalanche}
A single bit change in the input affects approximately half of the output bits after one application of $T_{odd}$.
\end{theorem}

This property emerges from the carry propagation in binary addition and multiplication:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiplication by 3 spreads changes through bit positions
\item Addition of 1 creates carry chains
\item Division by $2^{\tau(n)}$ preserves the diffusion
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Compression Function Analysis}

The compression phase, governed by $\tau(n)$, plays a crucial role:

\begin{theorem}[Compression Distribution]\label{thm:compression}
For random odd $n$, the probability that $\tau(n) = k$ is approximately $2^{-k}$.
\end{theorem}

This geometric distribution ensures that large compression events occur with positive probability, forcing eventual descent.
