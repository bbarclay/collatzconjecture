# Verification and Integration Plan

## Core Principles

1. **Code-Paper Consistency**
   - All code in LaTeX must exist in src/ with identical functionality
   - All mathematical claims in LaTeX must have corresponding verification code
   - No code modifications without updating corresponding LaTeX sections
   - No LaTeX modifications without verifying code still matches

2. **Version Control Rules**
   - Python files in src/ are source of truth for implementations
   - LaTeX sections are source of truth for mathematical claims
   - Data files in data/ are source of truth for results
   - All changes must maintain these relationships

## Verification Procedure

### 1. Code Extraction and Verification
1. Extract all code snippets from LaTeX files:
   ```bash
   for file in sections/*.tex; do
     grep -A 20 "\\begin{lstlisting}" "$file" > "code_review/${file%.tex}_code.txt"
   done
   ```
2. For each code snippet:
   - Verify it exists in src/ directory
   - Run tests to ensure functionality matches paper claims
   - Document any discrepancies in AUDIT.md

### 2. Mathematical Claims Verification
1. For each theorem/lemma in LaTeX:
   - Locate corresponding verification code
   - Run verification with test cases
   - Document numerical evidence in data/
   - Cross-reference with computational_verification.tex

### 3. Results Reproduction
1. For each figure/table in paper:
   - Locate generating code in src/
   - Verify data files exist in data/
   - Reproduce results with documented parameters
   - Compare with stored versions

## Integration Checklist

### 1. Code Integration
- [ ] All code snippets extracted and cataloged
- [ ] Each snippet mapped to src/ implementation
- [ ] All implementations tested
- [ ] Test coverage documented
- [ ] Performance metrics recorded

### 2. Mathematical Integration
- [ ] All theorems mapped to verification code
- [ ] All lemmas have test cases
- [ ] All proofs checked against implementation
- [ ] Edge cases documented and tested
- [ ] Numerical evidence archived

### 3. Results Integration
- [ ] All figures reproducible from src/
- [ ] All data files present and documented
- [ ] All results verified and validated
- [ ] All parameters documented
- [ ] All visualizations consistent

## Review Process

1. **Code Review**
   - Review each src/ file against LaTeX snippets
   - Run all tests and document results
   - Check for consistent style and documentation
   - Verify error handling and edge cases

2. **Paper Review**
   - Check all cross-references
   - Verify theorem numbering
   - Ensure code listings match src/
   - Validate all citations

3. **Results Review**
   - Reproduce all computational results
   - Verify all figures and tables
   - Check all numerical claims
   - Document reproduction steps

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Each src/ file must have:
     - Purpose and relationship to paper
     - Input/output specifications
     - Example usage
     - Test coverage report

2. **Results Documentation**
   - Each data/ file must have:
     - Generating code reference
     - Parameter settings
     - Timestamp and version
     - Verification status

3. **Integration Documentation**
   - Map of code snippets to implementations
   - Map of theorems to verification code
   - Map of results to generating code
   - Complete reproduction instructions

## Modification Rules

1. **Code Modifications**
   - Must update corresponding LaTeX sections
   - Must pass all tests
   - Must maintain backward compatibility
   - Must document changes in CHANGELOG.md

2. **Paper Modifications**
   - Must verify code still matches
   - Must update all cross-references
   - Must maintain theorem consistency
   - Must document changes in CHANGELOG.md

## Quality Assurance

1. **Automated Checks**
   - Run all unit tests
   - Verify all code snippets compile
   - Check cross-references
   - Validate bibliography

2. **Manual Checks**
   - Review all proofs
   - Verify figure quality
   - Check narrative consistency
   - Validate mathematical claims

## Emergency Procedures

1. **Code-Paper Mismatch**
   - Document discrepancy in AUDIT.md
   - Do not modify code without paper update
   - Do not modify paper without code verification
   - Get explicit approval for changes

2. **Results Mismatch**
   - Document in AUDIT.md
   - Preserve both versions
   - Investigate discrepancy
   - Update only with full verification

## Final Deliverables

1. **Code Package**
   - Clean src/ directory
   - Complete test suite
   - Documentation
   - Usage examples

2. **Paper Package**
   - Final LaTeX files
   - All figures
   - Complete bibliography
   - Supplementary materials

3. **Verification Package**
   - Test results
   - Reproduction instructions
   - Audit trail
   - Change log
